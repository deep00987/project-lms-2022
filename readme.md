# Database Initialization and Dependency Installation

To set up the database and install the necessary dependencies for your project, follow these steps:
## Initializing the Database 
1. **Database Creation Script** : Locate the `database_create_script.sql` file. This script is typically found in the `schema_sql` folder of your project.

```bash
/path/to/project/schema_sql/database_create_script.sql
``` 
2. **Execute SQL Script** : Use a database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, or a command-line tool like `mysql` or `psql`) to run the `database_create_script.sql` script. This script will create the necessary tables and schema for your application.

Example using `mysql` command-line tool:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < /path/to/project/schema_sql/database_create_script.sql
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_database_name` with your actual database credentials.
## Installing Dependencies 
1. **Node.js Project** : If your project is a Node.js application, you need to install its dependencies. Navigate to the root folder of your project in the terminal.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
``` 
2. **npm Install** : Run the following command to install the required dependencies listed in your project's `package.json` file.

```bash
npm install
```



This command will download and install all the dependencies specified in your project, ensuring that your application has the necessary libraries and packages to run.

Your database should now be initialized, and your project's dependencies should be installed. You can proceed with running your application.

Remember to replace `/path/to/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

Your project is now set up and ready to go!
